// We can create more than one package inside the src file [src is called source file]
// We can create more than one class inside a package

// here public --> is called access modifier, class --> type, HelloWorld --> is the name of the class
// The system create a class for us, we didn't type it

public class HelloWorld {
	// main method
	// This is the entry point of the Java
	// This is used to execute the code
	// If this is absent, execution of code is not possible, very common mistake
	// This is a system generated method, name is 'main'
	// What is the shortcut of creating a main method? 
	// Ans: Type 'main' inside the class body and then press Enter button.
	// All the execution come from main method
	// How many main method present inside one class? Ans:  'only one' 
	// try to create another main method inside/outside the class]
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// you have to type 'syso' to print something, and then press Enter
		// below line is also system generated printing command, used for printing
		// something
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
		// common mistake: we forgot to put quotation (double quotation) inside
		// parenthesis,
		// For execution: We have to save the code (Manually by clicking save/save all
		// button on the top left)
		// Windows user: keyboard shortcut: save (ctrl+s), saveAll (ctrl+shift+s)
		// Mac user: keyboard shortcut: save (command+s), saveAll (command+shift+s)

	}
	
}

// This part is called Editor
// Below part where you get the outcome as "Hello World!" is called Console

// How to Execute/Run the code? 
// 1) Green play button form the header
// 2) right click on Editor -- then 'run as' -- 'java application' 
// 3) from the top of the page from 'Run' -- then 'run as' -- 'java application' 
// 4) go to the class on left and do the right click -- then 'run as' -- 'java application'
