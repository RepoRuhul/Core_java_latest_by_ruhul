// How to solve indentation issue?
// 1st way to solve a single line: control/command + i
// limitation: it can't remove the white space

// how to solve multiple lines? (not practiced)
// select those lines or use control/command+a TO SELECT ALL
// control/command + i
// limitation: it can't remove white space

// Always use below command
// what is the final solution for indentation issue/problem?
// shift + control/command + f
// advantage: it can also remove white space 
// but can't remove WHITE SPACE from the String [What is inside double quotation is called String]

// When your coding is done, always follow shift + control/command + f  and then save all (shift + control/command + s)
// how to save a single class -- control/command+s
// how to save all the classes opened -- shift + control/command+s
